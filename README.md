## Project Overview
This project applies a deep learning model to predict whether an organization funded by Alphabet Soup will be successful, based on historical application data.

## Repository Contents
- `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb` — Preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation notebook.
- `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5` — Saved optimized deep learning model.
- `AlphabetSoupCharity_Report.md` — Detailed report on data preprocessing, model evaluation, and optimization steps.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## How to Use
Open the Jupyter Notebook `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb` to see the data preprocessing, model creation, and training steps.  
The best model is saved as `AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.h5`.

For detailed analysis and results, refer to the `AlphabetSoupCharity_Report.md`.
